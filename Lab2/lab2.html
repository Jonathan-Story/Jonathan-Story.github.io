      <h1>Lab Report - Lab 1: Basic Decimal Matlab</h1>

      <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this lab is to introduce the use of the TIMS machine
          and to simulate a simple signal function. Additionally, the lab
          provides practice in using the signal analysis software. The lab
          provides a baseline for how to go about future lab procedures.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="procedures">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          <br /><b>Part A: PC-MODULES CONTROLLER and PicoScope</b><br />
          The first part of this lab involved utilizing picoscope for the first
          time to read a simple waveform. The waveform was generated by the TIMS
          unit and was created by putting connector wires from ChA to the 2kHz
          MESSAGE on the MASTER SIGNAL module and putting another wire from ChB1
          to the 8.3 kHz SAMPLE CLOCK shown in the figures in the lab procedure.
          The lab gave instructions on how to read in these signals through
          picoscope by turnign on each signal. Below is the result of showing
          both signals in picoscope.
          <img src="/Lab2/Step4Result.png" alt=" " />
          Additionally, the lab demonstrated how to use spectrum mode in
          picoscope and how to shacne the spectrum range and how this range
          effects the signal shown in picoscope. The screenshot below shows the
          result of the same signals from above shown in spectrum mode.
          <img src="/Lab2/Step5Result.png" alt=" " />

          <br /><b>Part B: Triggering</b><br />
          The second part of the lab involved using the trigger parameter in
          picoscope. The lab demostrated how to use triggering to stabilize the
          signal shown in picoscope. Additionally, the lab the difference
          between using a rising and falling edge trigger and what that does for
          the output in picoscope. Triggering is an essential for being able to
          get a signal to show up in a desired fashion.

          <br /><b>Part C: TIMS S&S SFP</b><br />
          Part C of the lab involved using the TIMS S&S SFP software. This
          software is a way to get premade signals into picoscope utilizing the
          ARB1 and ARB2 TIMS modules that connect the unit to the lab computer.
          Once the computer is connected to the TIMS unit, the SFP software can
          be used to generate signals for each lab meeting. When connected to
          picoscope, the same signals shown to be generated in the software are
          shown in picoscope. This tool is useful as it allows for any signal to
          be input simply via software.

          <br /><b>Part D: SFP Control of Triple ADDER Gains</b><br />
          Part D of this lab involves utilizng a TIMS unit module that adds can
          add three signals together. It is important to note the slot of the
          TIMS unit that the module is placed in so that the software can
          interact witht hte module properly. I placed my triple adder in slot
          5. The procedure for part D involves interconnecting the triple adder
          with a 2kHz MESSAGE signals and the 8.3kHz signal into the input of
          the triple adder. ChB1 is the connected to the output of the triple
          adder, making ChB1 the resulting sum of the two input signals.
          Additonally the SFP software is used in this process when modifying
          the gain of either waveform. The screenshot below shows the result of
          the two signals being added together and the gain of the signals being
          modified.

      <div class="section" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <br /><b>What did you enjoy about this lab?</b><br />
          I enjoyed the hands on aspect of this lab. It was nice to be able to
          see where the signals were coming from and how they were output into
          the software.

          <br /><b>What didn't go well in this lab</b><br />
          Something that did not go well was figuring out what the picture was
          showing. I missinterpreted the picture and had to ask for help from my
          TA. She showed me that I can stack the wire plugs on top of each other
          to connect them together.

          <br /><b
            >How would you improve the lab experiment for the future classes?</b
          ><br />
          Something that could be improved is the clarity of the pictures in the
          lab write up. I think they could have indicators as to what part of
          the picture the procedure is talking about.
