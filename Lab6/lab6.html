      <h1>Lab Report - Lab 6: System Linearity TIMS</h1>

      <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this lab was to show the properties of linearity by using
          the TIMS unit to make a variety of signal input and outputs. We used a
          variety of modules to accomplish the transformation of the signals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="procedures">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          <br />A.1 Comparator <br />
          Steps A.1 1-4 were to test the lienarity of the comparator module by
          using an input wave and looking at it's output as the amplifier was
          increased. Below are the results of the test in a graph form. <br />
          <img src="comparator.png" alt="Comparator Graph" />
          This system is not linear because as the input Voltage increased the
          output of the comparator stayed aroudn the same value. <br />
          <br />A.2 Rectifier <br />
          The steps for A.2 1-2 were to once again test the linearity of a
          module. This time we were to test the rectifier module by using an
          input wave and seeing the change of the output as the input increased.
          Below are the results of the test in a graph form.The rectifier is
          shown as the blue line and the red line is the previous test
          comparator. <br />
          <img src="rectifier.png" alt="Rectifier Graph" />
          The result for the rectifier module would lead me to believe that the
          system is a linear one as when the input increased the output
          increased the same amount. <br />
          <br />A.3 Multiplier <br />
          The steps for A.3 1-2 were to test the linearity of the multiplier by
          testing the property of additivity. Below arr the results of the test
          in a table and those table values in a graph. <br />
          <img src="table1.png" alt="Multiplier table" />
          <img src="multiplier.png" alt="Multiplier Graph" />
          These results show that the system is not linear as the output starts
          increasing out of step with the input increase. The results do show
          the half angle formula described because as soon as the input gets to
          3 the outputs are skewed and are then shown to be non-linear. <br />
          <br />B.1 DC Control<br />
          Steps B.1 1-6 were to set up the picoscope to display a DC output that
          was controlled by an input sinusoidal wave. Additonally we were to
          test the linearity of the system as we increased the output voltage
          from -2V to 2V. Below is a table showing the results of the test and a
          graph to visually represent the table <br />
          <img src="table2.png" alt="DC Control Table" />
          <img src="dccontrol.png" alt="DC Control Graph" />
          This system is linear as when the DC controlled voltage was increased
          the frequency was inversely decreased which is still a linear
          relationship. <br />
          <br />B.2 Frequency Control <br />
          An obvious application of a system that has a modulating frequency
          output would be a radio since controlling the input modifies the
          frequency of the output wave. This could work chanigng stations at
          varying frequencies. <br />

          <br />
          C.1 The Integrator <br />
          Steps C.1 1-6 show how the integrator module works. The integrator
          displays the in picoscope as an input wave that is a saw tooth wave.
          The output of the system shows the integral of this function as a
          square wave which is the expected result.Below is the result from
          picoscope <br />
          <img src="C1.png" alt="Integrator Graph" />
          <br />C.2 Feeback System <br />
          Step C.2 of the lab was to demonstrate how a feedback wave works when
          looked at up close. The feeback wave takes time to get to the actual
          output that is desired when it is triggered. This time can be measured
          by mutliplying the peak of the pulse when it triggers by e^-1 and
          calculating the time it takes to reach that value. The time it took
          for my simulation was around 66 microseconds. <br />

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <br />What did you enjoy about this lab?<br />
          I enjoyed using more complex modules to integrate and multiply waves
          together.
          <br />What didnâ€™t go well in this lab?<br />
          It took me a while to figure out what the goal of step C.2 was and how
          to measure that time.
          <br />How would you improve the lab experiment for future classes?<br />
          I would improve the instructions. It would be helpful to mention the
          order that the picoscope and arb software shoudl be opened in as this
          caused me some issues.
