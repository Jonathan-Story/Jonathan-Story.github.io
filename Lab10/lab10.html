      <h1>Lab Report - Lab 10: Fourier Series Matlab</h1>

      <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this lab, the objective is to utilize code provided to</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="procedures">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          <br />A.1) What happens to the overall signal when harmonics are
          added?<br />
          When I run the sections that have more harmonics added the sound
          played is not only way louder but also has a higher pitch.
          Additionally the sound has a sort of distortion sound to it when there
          are more harmonics.

          <br /><br />A.2) Observe each plot, listen to the associated sound and
          explain the relationship you notice between plot and corresponding
          sound. <br />
          When lookign at the different plots I notice dthat as the number of
          harmonics increases the plot that matlab produces becomes more and
          more condensed and starts to resemble a square wave.

          <br /><br />B.1) Write a brief description of how CODE 2 implements
          the Fourier series described by Equation (1). <br />
          The code implements the fourier series by using a for loop to add up
          all the sin waves using certain coefficients. The number of waves it
          adds together depends on the user input. The higher the input the more
          square the output is going to look.

          <br /><br />B.2) Using the command hold on, plot the graph produced by
          CODE 1 and CODE 2 on the same picture. Consider the number of terms
          N_TERMS = 7. Insert a legend on your plot describing the two signals:
          name the ideal square wave f(x) and the approximation f’(x).

          <img src="/Lab10/B2.png" alt="" />

          <br /><br />B.3) Run the code that results from B.2 for N_TERMS =
          10,20 and 30 without closing the Figure each time you run. This way
          you will have multiple plots on Figure 1. Include the plot on your
          report and answer the following question: considering the ideal square
          wave f(x) as a reference, where in the signal wave do the
          approximations of f(x) have the greatest error/oscillation?

          <img src="/Lab10/B3.png" alt="" />

          When looking at he resulting waves it is plain to see that the
          greatest error occurs when the wave needs to make the jump to one.
          After this point the line is straight and the sine waves can get
          pretty close to a constant value.

          <br /><br />B.4) The Gibbs phenomenon is an overshoot (or "ringing")
          of the Fourier series. Defining the overshoot as the difference in
          amplitude between the highest point of the approximation and the
          reference function, record the overshoot values in Table 1 associated
          with each of the following number of terms. What is the relationship
          between the overshoot and the number of terms in the series? <br />

          <img src="/Lab10/table1.png" alt="" />

          The overshoot seems to decrease as the number of terms increases.
          These values were recorded measuring the highest point of the
          approximation and the reference function. The overshoot is the
          difference between these two values.

          <br /><br />B.5) Run CODE 2 multiple times (for N_TERMS = 7,20,30,50
          and 100.) and, using the command tic toc, record in Table 2 the time
          MATLAB takes to perform the approximation of f(x). Notice that you can
          uncomment % tic and % toc to perform the required task. Table 2 –
          Computational time for different number of terms of the FS.

          <img src="/Lab10/table2.png" alt="" />

          The above table shows how the computational time increases as the
          number of terms increases.

          <br /><br />B.6) From the previous problems it could be noticed that,
          the higher number of terms of the series is, more precise the
          approximation will be; however, the computational time cost increases.
          In practice, we must find a balance between precision and
          computational cost when using Fourier series. What determines this
          balance? <br />
          The balance is determined by the application of the fourier series. If
          a very precise answer is needed then the computational time is worth
          it. However, if the application is not as precise then the
          computational time is not worth it. These two factors must be traded
          off to get the best result and is completely based off what type of
          system is being used. If the system is a very complex periodic system
          then the computational time is worth it. However, if the system is a
          simple square wave then the computational time is not worth it.

          <br /><br />C.1) CODE 2 implements the approximation of a square wave
          using Fourier series. Modify this code so that it will produce the
          approximation of a triangular wave (more specifically, a sawtooth
          wave) similar to the one shown in Figure 1. In your report, include,
          on the same figure, plots of the approximated sawtooth function
          considering N_TERMS = 10,20 and 30.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <br />What did you enjoy about this lab?<br />
          I really enjoyed this lab and making a fourier series in matlab. It
          was cool to see how the square wave can be approximated so easily. The
          sound portion was interesting as well and goes ot show the
          complexities of sound engineering.
          <br />What didn’t go well in this lab?<br />
          I did not realize that the first part of this lab was going to make
          noise and it was very loud with earphones on :o
          <br />How would you improve the lab experiment for future classes?<br />
          I would add mmaybe a live script to be able to actively interact with
          the fourier series.
