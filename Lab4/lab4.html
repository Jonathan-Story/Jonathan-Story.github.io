      <h1>Lab Report - Lab 4: Special Signals TIMS</h1>

      <div class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this lab is to utilize more TIMS unit modules to produce
          even more signals. This lab requires measurement of various wave
          values and the measurement tools that are used to measure these are
          new to this lab as well. The lab procedure provides steps to making
          these new signals and utilizing the measurement tools to find the
          values of these signals. Additionally, the lab shows us how these
          signals interact with each other under certain conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="procedures">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          <br /><b>Part A: Digital Pulse Sequence</b><br />
          A.1.5<br />
          In the first steps of the lab the procedure introduces the use of a
          new module called the Audio Oscillator. This allows the user to
          manipulate the frequency of the signal by turning the knob on the
          module. In steps A1-5 the lab calls for pluggin in the module and then
          adjusting the knob to see the output in picoscope. The screenshot
          below shows the output of the signal in picoscope. Additionally, it
          shows how to measure places on a signal. The lab procedure asks for
          the values of one pulse width and the clock cycle at 1kHz.The results
          below were measured<br />
          Pulse Width: 518us <br />
          Clock Cycle: 998.8us
          <br />
          A.2 <br />
          Steps 1 - 5 of A.2 ivnlove utilizing the Audio Oscillator with the
          tims machine to generate a digital signal to show on the picoscope
          <img src="/Lab4/lab4A2.png" alt=" " />
          The minimum time Interval of the signal is one of the measurements
          required.<br />
          Minimum Time Interval: .5ms<br />
          A.3 - Baseband Channel Filters<br />
          Steps 1 - 5 of A.3 involve using the baseband channel filters to give
          a variety of different signals jsut by turnign a know to a certain
          setting. The below table (Table 1) shows the different measurements
          for each setting of the knob.<br />
          <img src="/Lab4/table1.png" alt="" />

          In steps A.3 6-8 of the procedure, the lab asks us to look at how the
          signals don't show a perfect ona nd off when the clock signal is high
          to low. As the frequency of the clock increased the correspoinding
          signal was no longer able to keep up and rise in time for the clock
          signals next pulse. This resulf was achieved when the frequency of the
          clock got up to 3.87 kHz. The screenshot below shows the result of the
          indistinguishable signal.
          <img src="/Lab4/lab4A3.png" alt="" />

          <br /><b>Part B: Step Input</b><br />
          Steps 1 - 4 of the procedure involve utilizign the audio oscillator
          and the TIMS unit to make another digital signal where the pulses of
          the output aren't perfect and take time to turn on and off. Picoscope
          is then used to measure the parts of the signal that are important.
          Below is a table (Table 2)showing the results of these
          measurements.<br />
          <img src="/Lab4/table2.png" alt="" />

          <br /><b>Part C: Impulse</b><br />
          Steps 1 - 4 of part C involve utilizing the sequence generator module
          in combination with the audio oscillator to create an impulse signal
          to view on picoscope. The below table and graph show the relationship
          between frequency and the Pulse Width. THe data was obtained by
          turning the knob of the oscillator and measuring on picoscope.<br />

          <img src="/Lab4/table3.png" alt="" />
          <img src="/Lab4/graph1.png" alt="" />

          Steps C 6 - 9 of the procedure involves increasing frequency of the
          input signal slowly to see how the amplitude of the output signal
          decreases. The amplitude of this output is shrinking because the
          cycles are too fast for the <br />

          <br /><b>Part D: Sinusoidal Signals</b><br />
          D1.1 - Basic Sine Waves <br />
          Steps D.1 1 - 7 of the procedure call for using the amplifier module
          in tandem with the rest of the modules utilized prior in the lab to
          make a signal that displays as one input signal and an amplified
          output signal on the picoscope. Below are the results of each filter
          at a variety of frequency and their peak to peak voltages.
          <img src="/Lab4/table4.png" alt="" />
          As the frequency increases for each filter mode, the clarity of the
          output signal gets worse and worse.
          <br />D.2 - Clipping <br />
          For D.2 the procedure calls for increasing the amplification using the
          amplifier module knob. As the output signal was increasingly
          amplified, the signal is distorted intensely. When I brought the
          signal slowly to 20 Vpp the output signal hit a limit and would not
          increase anymore.

          <br /><b>Part E: Digital Detector</b><br />
          The final step of this lab was to setup another signal where the input
          and output were displayed on the picoscope. The operations used made
          the output signal the inverse of the input clock signal. The next part
          of the procedure had the frequency increased to see how the inverse
          output gets distorted. Below is a table showing how distortion
          effected the binary of the signal.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <br /><b>What did you enjoy about this lab?</b><br />
          I enjoyed the hands on aspect of this lab. I found it interesting to
          use so many modules and being able to wire up a bunch of different
          signals that were all unique.

          <br /><b>What didn't go well in this lab</b><br />
          Something that did not go well was figuring out how to properly
          measure the siganls using the picoscope software. After I figured out
          the measurement tools I found the rest of the lab to be
          straightforward.

            >How would you improve the lab experiment for the future classes?</b
          ><br />
          Something that could be improved is the clarity of the pictures in the
          lab write up. I think they could have indicators as to what part of
          the picture the procedure is talking about.
